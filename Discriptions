CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED

RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural

language processing and conversation flow.

#How This Works:
Uses simple if-elif-else rules to detect keywords in user input.
Converts user input to lowercase for easy matching.
Continues running until the user types 'exit' or 'bye'.

#What You Learn from This:
Basics of input handling.
Basics of conversation flow control.
How to create rules for responses.
Importance of pattern matching.
